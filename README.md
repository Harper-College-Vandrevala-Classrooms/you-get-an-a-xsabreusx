# You Get an A! - C++ Template

This program simulates a gradebook for tracking student grades in a course.

## Things you can do using this Gradebook class: 
### (Assuming you want to make your own main() function and not use the existing one)

1. Add students with their first name, last name, and student ID.
2. Add assignments with their name and total possible points.
3. Assign grades to students for specific assignments already entered.
4. Print a report showing all students and their grades.

## Example Commands:

- Add Student: `gb.addStudent("John", "Doe", 101);`
- Add Assignment: `gb.addAssignment("Assignment1", 100);`
- Assign Grade: `gb.assignGrade(101, "Assignment1", 85);`

## Compilation:

If you compile the program using VScode, ensure that your main.cpp file and Gradebook.cpp are included in the compilation process.
Alternatively, can use Visual Studio to compile the project and solution. 

## Default Run:

### If you don't erase the existing main and you just compile as is, the command prompt will provide the option to do a sample run. 
### Follow the instructions in the menu to navigate and test the application.
